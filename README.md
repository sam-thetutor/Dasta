## Overview
Stellar AI Agent is an intelligent, conversational assistant for blockchain financial management. It enables users to perform all major blockchain actions—such as sending and receiving tokens, creating payment links, checking balances, swapping assets, managing investments, and automating recurring tasks—using simple natural language prompts. The agent acts as a unified interface, automating complex workflows and providing personalized financial assistance based on user preferences and risk tolerance.

## Problem Statement
Navigating blockchain networks and ecosystems is often a fragmented and overwhelming experience for users. To perform basic and advanced financial actions—such as sending or receiving tokens, investing, or creating payment links—users are forced to jump between multiple platforms, each with its own interface and requirements. This means:

- **Platform Fragmentation**: Users must find and use different platforms for each task (wallet management, payments, trading, investing, etc.), leading to a disjointed experience.
- **Wallet Hassles**: Every time a user visits a new platform, they must create or connect their wallet again, repeating onboarding steps and exposing themselves to potential security risks.
- **Steep Learning Curve**: Each blockchain network and platform introduces new concepts, terminology, and workflows that users must learn before they can confidently interact with the ecosystem.
- **Missed Opportunities**: Users often miss out on market trends, investment opportunities, or timely actions simply because they are busy or unable to monitor the ecosystem constantly.
- **Repetitive Manual Tasks**: Routine actions—like buying tokens daily or setting up recurring investments—require manual intervention, making the process tedious and error-prone.

These challenges create significant friction, discourage adoption, and prevent users from fully leveraging the benefits of blockchain technology. There is a clear need for an intelligent, unified, and user-friendly solution that streamlines blockchain financial management, automates routine and advanced tasks, and empowers users to participate in the ecosystem with ease—all through natural language interactions.

- **One-Time Wallet Integration**: Users connect their wallet once and can interact with multiple services without repeated onboarding or reconnection.
- **Natural Language Prompts**: The AI agent interprets user instructions in plain language, eliminating the need to understand complex blockchain concepts or technical jargon.

- **Personalized Financial Assistant**: The agent can invest on the user's behalf based on their risk tolerance, monitor trends, and alert users to opportunities, ensuring they never miss out due to lack of time or expertise.
